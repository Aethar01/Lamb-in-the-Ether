## Welcome to the Lamb in the Ether site!
<!-- truncate -->
It's a pleasure to have you here. Everyone at Lamb in the Ether is excited to share our thoughts, ideas and games with you! We hope you enjoy your stay and come back often to see what we're up to.

## Details
The site is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) so check them out if you're interested in building your own site.
Right now we're using github pages to host the site and for the moment we aren't expecting a lot of traffic so it should be fine. If we start to get more traffic we'll look into other hosting options such as Netlify.

If you have any questions or comments feel free to reach out to us on our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/y6nZKTEZ9J)! We'd love to hear from you.

Cheers,  
Elliott
