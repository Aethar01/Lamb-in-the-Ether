# Bastion
Bastion was a summer project of ours to design a TTRPG, we hope that you enjoy what we've created or feel inspired to create your own TTRPGs.

Bastion features a classless system originally inspired by the character creation found in the Dark Souls trilogy and Elden Ring. The Push and Punish mechanic was designed to try and emulate the feeling of risk and reward found in the Souls-like genre.

Other inspirations include, ICON, D&D, FitD, Mausritter, and Knave (from which the equipment tables are derived).
