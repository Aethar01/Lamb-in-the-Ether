# The Continent of Andar Ikith
Andar-Ikith is sprawling continent of shattered landscapes and war torn pastures, it is in constant civil war between large empires that surround the Akaron's southern pole.  
After the Massacre of the Innocents, part of which involves when the Queen of Inima, Verika Lorelien, was usurped by Jeren Orel, the continent was once again plunged into chaos which only grew worse after The Mass Ascension Event, which saw the beginning of the crusades under the banner of Gregor.
